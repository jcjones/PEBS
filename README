PEBS is a backup infastructure written by James 'Pug' Jones 
 <pug@pugsplace.net> on 13 January 2006. These scripts are 
 licensed under the GNU GPL version 2 or later. See the included 
 LICENSE file.

These scripts use GPG, OpenSSH, BASH and Moshe Jacobson's "color" 
shell utility. 

"color" can be obtained at http://www.runslinux.net/projects.html

Features:

    * Written in BASH with minimal dependencies
    * Provides a simple scripting language for defining what you’d like backed up
    * Can be used on a multi-user system with each user defining what files they would like backed up via the scripting system (this is unsecure, presently, though)
    * Uses GPG and your public key to encrypt the final backup archive before transmitting it to the remote host


Requirements:

    * A unix-like system
    * GnuPG (for encryption)
    * OpenSSH (for secure data transfer)
    * GNU Tar (for backup storage)
    * GZip (for backup compression)
    * OpenSSH must be setup with an automatic authentication method, such as a public key cryptography

Configuration consists of two steps, configuring the script’s overall options and writing one or more backup definition script.

    1. Overall Configuration
        The overall configuration is pretty easy. Copy 
        configuration.inc.sh-sample to configuration.inc.sh and 
        edit the values to meet your needs.
        
    2. Writing one or more backup definition scripts
        This is described within comments in the sample script
        located in individual_scripts/basic.inc.sh-sample .
        
Once configured, just run pebs.sh.
